    <h1>JOLLOF RICE RECIPE</h1>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a delicacy that began in West Africa, but because of frequent cultural exchange amongst various
        regions, the recipe continues to spread far and wide. It is considered a celebratory dish and popular in West
        African nations like Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of rice</li>
        <li>1kg of Chicken/beef</li>
        <li>1000ml of Ground Fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>50ml of Ground Fresh peppers</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Nutmeg powder</li>
        <li>2 seasoning of cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup of sliced onions</li>
        <li>300ml vegetable</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 fingers of ginger</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken/beef with a teaspoon of salt, one seasoning cubes, half a teaspoon each of curry and
            thyme, half a cup of sliced onions then let it sit for some minutes.
            Set on heat and let it boil for 10-15 minutes, would take more time to cook the beef.</li>
        <li>Set aside the meat and the stock in fresh bowls. Peel off the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound, or
            grind.</li>
        <li>Parboil rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow
            boiling for 3 minutes. Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water, then set aside in a bowl or
            plastic sieve.</li>
        <li>Pick out the parboiled tasty meat and deep-fry, set aside.</li>
        <li>Once you are done with frying the chicken, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of
            sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes, add the ground tomatoes. I like to cook jollof rice with the same oil I
            used while frying the meat.
            Using a fresh oil is just the same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually holds over
            70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian foods.</li>
        <li>Frying the tomatoes would take about 20 minutes.
            Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon, you will notice the oil continues to boil in the
            spoon.
            You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.</li>
        <li>Once the tomato is well fried, add the meat water (chicken/beef stock) to the fried tomato in the pot, the
            ground ginger/garlic, half a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, salt to taste, add 4 cups of water.
            Add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Donâ€™t worry, once the rice is
            added the taste would balance.</li>
        <li>Add the rice. Then cover and allow the rice to cook on low heat for 30-45 minutes. Remember that you can add
            water occasionally. Voila!!!
            Turn and serve with the fried meat.</li>
    </ol>
